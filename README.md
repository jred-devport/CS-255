**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was an attempt at taking advantage of a lack of DMV driving test training. It was to be a web-based system where customers could sign up for in person instruction and online tests to train for the driving test. 
We made a web-based dashboard system for displaying tests and signing up for instructor training. It had a browser displayed front-end with a cloud backend and database. 
    
**What did you do particularly well?**

I think my diagrams were formatted particularly well. They were not overly complicated but easy to read.
    
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would choose to spend more time developing the details of the system design. In our 8 week course, I felt there was not enought time to really drill down to everything that needed to be done in the design.
I would flesh out the diagrams and designs to make sure as much of the system is designed as is possible.
    
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Using the interview transcript, I was able to organize and implement the information the client provided into the design. The user's needs are key in the design. If the system did not meet user needs, then the project would be considered a failure. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I approach designing software from a top down perspective. I feel it is best to get a full overview of what the user wants the system to look like. After you have an overview, it is much easier to focus down on the details while keeping the entire system in mind. 
The various UML diagrams are extremely effective at creating that overview. I would use them extensively in future projects.
